*Agile project management | Week 3*

# Introduction: Implementing Scrum

Setup and day-to-day execution of a Scrum Team, share the most popular tools, methods, tips, and tricks for working with a ST.

How to manage your product backlog; estimation; relative effort estimation; five important Scrum events: Sprint, the Sprint Planning, the Daily Scrum, the Sprint Review, and the Sprint Retrospective. Velocity, turndown charts. Google Docs, JIRA, Asana, Trello Kanban boards: help workflow stay organized and transparent. 

# Building a Product Backlog

Definition: the single authoritative source for things that a team works on. Traditional non=Agile project management equivalent: project requirements. 

Three features of a PB
A living artifact, items are added to the backlog at any time
Owned and adjusted by the product owner. 
A prioritized list of features.

Product Backlog:
Item description; value field; estimate; order; 

# Product Backlog: The Scrum Guide overview

Product backlog: an ordered list of what needs to be done to improve a product. 

Product Goal: long-term objective for the Scrum Team. The rest of the product backlog defines what tasks will fulfill the Product Goal.

# Writing user stories

User stories: short, simple solution that’s always centered around the user and the user experience. Made up of three elements: the user, the action they will take, and the benefit to them. Give these users a name and a backstory. User story meet six criteria: Independent, Negotiation, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable. 

Independent: the story’s completion is not dependent on another story
Negotiable: there is room for discussion about this item
Valuable: Completing the user story has to deliver value
Estimable: the definition of done must be clear so that the team can give each user story an estimate.
Small: each user story needs to be able to fit within a planned Sprint
Testable: a test can be conducted to check that it meets the criteria

Acceptance criteria: checklist used to decide whether the user story is done. 

Epics allow you to keep track of large, loosely-defined ideas, while user stories are a much smaller unit of work, inspired directly from the end user or customer. Both user stories and epics help teams ensure they are delivering value to the customer.

To pass this graded quiz, you must receive at least 80%, or 4 out of 5 points, by completing the activity and answering corresponding quiz questions. You can learn about the graded and practice items in the Course Overview.
Activity Overview
In this activity, you will write user stories and create acceptance criteria for each story based on customer needs. These user stories, collected under one epic, will form the basis of a Product Backlog.
Note: Throughout this course, you will complete tasks normally done by others (like the Development Team or Product Owner). Even if you don’t perform them yourself, it is important that you understand these processes. 
Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work. You will not be able to access the exemplar until you have completed this activity.
Scenario

Review the scenario below. Then complete the step-by-step-instructions.
Imagine you are overseeing the development and launch of Virtual Verde, Office Green's new product line. Virtual Verde’s mission is to make working from home more enjoyable by offering desk plants for home office use. New customers recently received the first batch of plants.
As a next step, your team had planned to introduce new product offerings to the Virtual Verde catalog—starting with Bonsai trees. However, a customer survey discovered that 70% of the new customers had difficulty caring for their plants. Many of the plants wilted and died within a month. This information inspired the team to develop new offerings and companion products to help new owners care for their plants.
From the survey, Office Green learned that they can create value for their customers by making it easy to:
Find out which plants are easiest to care for
Access care instructions easily
Have the right tools to care for their plants
Remember when to water their plants
Get expert help and advice quickly
Have a hassle-free way to return their orders
You will work with your team to create user stories that will help them build solutions to address these customer needs, and add them to the Product Backlog. Your team has already added Bonsai tree user stories to the Backlog, but the new plant care stories have now become the top priority.
Note: In general, the Product Owner leads in prioritizing the Backlog and addressing new concerns. Anyone can work on user stories, but the Development Team typically gives feedback on them.
Step-by-Step Instructions

Step 1: Access the template
To use the template for this course item, click the link below and select “Use Template.”

Step 2: Create six user stories
Using the Bonsai tree stories in the Backlog template as a model, create six new user stories—one to address each of the six customer needs from the scenario. Your user stories should follow this construction: 
As a <user role>, I want <this action> so that I can <get this value>. 
For the <user role> part of each story, consider what sort of person might have that specific customer need. They might be a potential customer, a new plant owner, or something else. Keep in mind that these stories should help customers who may not have much experience caring for plants.
For the <action> part of each user story, fill in the specific customer need. 
For the <value> part of each story, think about why your user might want to perform that particular action and how it will help them.
When completed, each story should express a customer need the team can work to fulfill. For example, imagine that a customer wants to learn about different styles of Bonsai cutting and shaping. A related user story might read:
“As a new Bonsai tree owner, I want to learn about different Bonsai styles so that I can pick the right one for my tree.” 
Step 3: Create acceptance criteria
Create at least two acceptance criteria for each story, and add them to the template. Remember that acceptance criteria help your team establish a Definition of Done. They represent the things your team needs to accomplish before they can consider the user story complete.
For example, the acceptance criteria for the Bonsai styles user story could include:
"Customers can access a guide to different styles (formal & informal upright, broom, cascade, etc.) on website"
"Customers can take a quiz to match their trees to suitable styles"
Step 4: Check your stories against the I.N.V.E.S.T. criteria
Next, consult the I.N.V.E.S.T. framework to make sure your user stories are concise, specific, and actionable.
Independent: The story’s completion is not dependent on another story. 
Negotiable: There is room for negotiation and discussion about how to complete the story.
Valuable: Completing the user story will deliver value for the user role. 
Estimable: The Definition of Done must be clear so that the team can give the story an estimate.
Small: Each user story and the work necessary to complete it should fit within a planned Sprint. 
Testable: A test can be conducted to make sure the story meets the acceptance criteria (even if the test is not yet planned). 
You may not be able to account for all the I.N.V.E.S.T. criteria in this exercise, but you should try to meet as many as you can. If a story meets three or fewer criteria, consider revising it.
Step 5: Title each user story
Create a title for each story and add it to the template. The titles should briefly describe the desired outcome for the user role, so the team can reference them quickly.
Step 6: Add an epic title
Create an epic title that can serve as a heading or a theme for all six stories—for example, “Plant Care Initiatives”—and add it to the Backlog template. 
Note: Keep in mind that a real Product Backlog would encompass all aspects of the project, including many different epics. For your reference, we have created a second epic as an example.
What to Include in Your Response

Be sure to address the following elements in your completed Product Backlog:
The Backlog contains six user stories.
The stories follow the correct construction: “As a <user role> I want <this action> so that I can <get this value>.”
The stories follow the I.N.V.E.S.T. framework.
Each story has two pieces of acceptance criteria.
The acceptance criteria are actionable tasks for the Scrum Team.

# Activity Exemplar: Create a Product Backlog
—-
Let’s examine the exemplar:
Low-maintenance options: The user story follows the correct structure and meets the I.N.V.E.S.T. criteria: “As a potential customer, I want to find out which plants are easiest to care for so that I can purchase low-maintenance options.” The acceptance criteria enable customers to sort plants by difficulty on the website and find out which plants have similar care needs.
Plant care tips: The user story follows the correct structure and meets the I.N.V.E.S.T. criteria: “As a plant owner, I want to access care instructions easily so that I can keep my plant alive longer.” The acceptance criteria enable customers to consult a plant care leaflet and sign up for monthly emails with seasonal tips.
Plant care tools: The user story follows the correct structure and meets the I.N.V.E.S.T. criteria: “As a plant owner, I want to have the right tools to care for my plant so that I can keep it healthy and beautiful.” The acceptance criteria enable customers to purchase plant care starter kits or buy tools individually.
Watering reminders: The user story follows the correct structure and meets the I.N.V.E.S.T. criteria: “As a plant owner, I want to remember when to water my plants so that I don't under- or overwater them.” The acceptance criteria enable customers to sign up to receive watering reminders and purchase reminder stickers for their calendars.
Expert help and advice: The user story follows the correct structure and meets the I.N.V.E.S.T. criteria: “As a plant owner, I want to get expert help and advice quickly so that I know what to do if my plant gets sick.” The acceptance criteria enable customers to access live chat support and call phone support during extended hours.
Return policy: The user story follows the correct structure and meets the I.N.V.E.S.T. criteria: “As a customer, I want a hassle-free way to return my order so that I can be sure I have the right plant for me.” The acceptance criteria enable customers to easily find credit and return information on the website and ship their returns with a pre-printed label.
Finally, because the stories all relate to helping customers care for their plants, they all belong to an epic titled “Plant Care Initiatives.”

# Agile effort estimation techniques

Planning poker, dot voting, the bucket system, large/uncertain/small, ordering method, affinity mapping. 

Characteristics of effective estimation: Avoids gathering false precision of estimates; Avoids anchoring bias; Promotes inclusivity; Leads to effort discovery.

# T-shirt sizes and story points

T-shirt sizes: a way to measure an item or user story

Story points: agrees on permitted points value; identifies at least one anchor backlog item and agrees to assign it a points value; sorts through the remaining backlog items as a team.

Best practices
Some best practices, regardless of the technique you use, include:
Asking the Product Owner questions about the user story or item to ensure that there is enough information to estimate it.
Discussing divergent estimates from various team members so that everyone has a chance to understand how to implement the item.
Agreeing on the final T-shirt sizes or points value and capturing it in the system.
If certain items fall into the larger T-shirt size or story points value range, discussing whether it makes sense to break them down into smaller pieces before moving on.

To pass this practice quiz, you must receive 100%, or 3 out of 3 points, by completing the activity below. You can learn more about the graded and practice items in the Course Overview.
Activity Overview
In this activity, you will add estimates to user stories to the Virtual Verde Product Backlog to capture how much effort each user story will take to complete. These estimations help the Product Owner assess the workload captured in the Backlog, which helps them prioritize tasks.
Note: Throughout this course, you will complete tasks normally done by others (like the Development Team or Product Owner). Even if you don’t perform them yourself, it is important that you understand these processes. 
Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work. You will not be able to access the exemplar until you have completed this activity.
Scenario

Review the scenario below. Then complete the step-by-step-instructions. 
Along with the Product Owner and the team, you’ve created user stories and acceptance criteria for the Virtual Verde Product Backlog. Now you need to add effort estimations to each user story, which will help the team understand the amount of effort each task will take to complete. Once you have your estimations, the Product Owner can make any necessary adjustments to item priority in the Product Backlog. This information will help your team plan the upcoming Sprint.
The Product Owner has already added a value for each user story in the Product Backlog. In this exercise, value represents how valuable the final deliverable is to the user role or customer. These value points are designated by dollar signs (so, $ = 1 value point, $$ = 2 value points, etc.).
You will work with the Development Team to determine relative effort estimations for each Backlog item. Relative effort estimation isn’t just how much effort an item should take to complete. Instead, the Development Team evaluates the amount of effort each item takes compared to other items in the Product Backlog.
You can use a number of different methods to estimate effort. Your team has opted to use Story Points, which are based on the Fibonacci sequence of numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, etc.). For example, an item with an effort estimation of “1” should take little effort to complete, while an item estimated at “13” or “21” will take much more effort. There is no prescribed formula for determining Story Points. Rather, teams should work together to compare task estimations to one another.
Note: In a real project, your team would determine these estimations together, since it is crucial that the people who complete the work provide the estimates.

Step 2: Review the Product Backlog values and the Bonsai Trees estimates for the Bonsai Trees epic
In the previous activity, you entered new plant care user stories into a Product Backlog that already contained a second epic (“Bonsai Trees”). Before you add estimates to your user stories, review the estimates for the Bonsai epic. You can use these numbers as a baseline to determine the relative estimations for the plant care epic.
Step 3: Add the effort estimates to the Plant Care Initiatives epic
Consider how much effort the acceptance criteria for the "Plant Care Initiatives" compared to those in the "Bonsai Trees" epic. (If you're not sure, try discussing the tasks with a friend. That's what you'd do on a real Scrum Team!) Then select a Story Point value from the dropdown that makes sense relative to the "Bonsai Trees" estimations. Remember that "21" takes far more effort than "1."
For example, the user story “As a Bonsai tree owner, I want to have the right tools to care for my tree so I can shape and style it properly,” has an effort estimation of 13. Think about whether the "Plant Care Initiatives" user stories require more, less, or about the same amount of effort to make your estimations.

Assessment of Exemplar

Compare the exemplar to your completed adding estimation template. Review your work using each of the criteria in the exemplar. What did you do well? Where can you improve? Use your answers to these questions to guide you as you continue to progress through the course. 
Note: Your estimates may vary based on how you interpreted the acceptance criteria for easy story. 
Let’s review the estimations in the exemplar:
As a potential customer, I want to find out which plants are easiest to care for so that I can purchase low-maintenance options. Value: $$$. Estimation: 8.
Value is high, since finding the right plants can increase the chances of a new plant owner’s success. The search and sorting options should take less effort than the Bonsai Tools, since they won’t involve working with vendors to source items or materials. The effort is estimated at 8, which is lower than the estimate for the Bonsai Tools story.
As a plant owner, I want to access care instructions easily so that I can keep my plant alive longer. Value: $$$. Estimation: 8.
Value is high, since accessible care instructions can make it easier for customers to keep their plants healthy. As a landscaping company, Office Green already has the knowledge and resources to make the care leaflets. The effort involved is therefore closer to the search and sorting options than the Bonsai Tools story, so the effort is also estimated at 8.
As a plant owner, I want to have the right tools to care for my plant so that I can keep it healthy and beautiful. Value: $$. Estimation: 13.
The story brings value to customers because having the right tools can make it easier for customers to care for their plants. Your team may need to source or manufacture products, resulting in more effort, coordination, and costs for the company. Given the resources required, an effort estimation of 13 or higher is appropriate—similar to the Bonsai Tools story.
As a plant owner, I want to remember when to water my plants so that I don't under- or overwater them. Value: $$. Estimation: 5.
Watering reminders bring value to customers who have trouble remembering when their plants need attention. The reminder stickers should take less effort than the plant care leaflets, so the estimated effort is 5. 
As a plant owner, I want to get expert help and advice quickly so that I know what to do if my plant gets sick. Value: $. Estimation: 8.
The value of this item is lower, since customers are just as likely to search the internet for ways to cure their plants as they are to contact support. Live chat and longer phone support hours would be an extension of existing support services. Therefore, the effort required is 8, which is less than sourcing materials for plant care kits.
As a customer, I want a hassle-free way to return my order so that I can be sure I have the right plant for me. Value: $$. Estimation: 5.
The value of an easy return process is potentially high, since it can help with customer satisfaction and retention. The effort involved is relatively low, since linking the FAQ can be done quickly and Office Green has prior experience with shipping and returns. Effort is estimated at 5.

# Introduction to the Sprint

Sprint is where ideas are turned into value.

During the Sprint: no changes are made what would endanger the Sprint Goal; Quality does not decrease; the Product Backlog is refined as needed; Scope my be clarified and renegotiated with the Product Owner as more is learned.
