# Introduction: Applying Agile in the organization

How to use Scrum and Agile in daily life. Apply Agile thinking to job interviews and potential work scenarios. Implement Agile to deliver value and achieve your business goals. Techniques for responding to risks and team dynamics. Discuss Agile as it applies to the broader project management discipline.

# Maximizing value-driven delivery

Product value examples: financial benefits, user growth and engagement, compliance adherence. 

Building the right thing, building the thing right, and run it right. To ensure the team delivers value to users.

Build the right thing: understand what your customers want. Do they want to increase their brand recognition? Do they want to get more customers? Having a solution-oriented conversation with your customer will help you build the right thing.

Building the thing right: ensure your team only builds the requested or approved features. Avoid complexities in the product that do not add any value to the users. 

Run it right: think through how the user will interact with the product once it has been delivered. How do users get support. How does the product add value to users long after they initially received it? How do you make sure that new features and capabilities reach the existing users? 

# Forming a value-driven task force

Learning from case studies: in-depth, data-driven analyses of a business, community, or organization. These case studies are valuable tools for gaining key industry insights and learning from the successes and failures of your competitors. 

Questions to ask: what is the issue? What is the goal of the analysis? What is the context of the problem? What key facts should be considered? What alternatives are available to the decision-maker? What would you recommend, and why?

# Camron: How Agile can drive value

Agile is a framework and mindset that is open to that change and embraces it. 

Change is never free. It that change within your threshold or your budget to be able to adapt to get it right or get it better.

# Components of a value roadmap

It is an Agile way of mapping out the timelines and requirements for the product development process. A guide that demonstrates where to go, how to get there, and what to accomplish along the way in order to maximize value. 

Map out a product idea and the strategy for how to deliver it. 

A typical value roadmap contains: a product vision, a product roadmap, and release plans.

Product vision: defines what the product is, how it supports the customer’s business strategy, and who will use it. 

Product roadmap: the product owner is responsible for creating and maintaining. Provides a high-level view of the expected product, its requirements, and an estimated schedule for reaching milestones. 

A series of release plans: product owner and project manager work to develop plans. Release plans includes the approximate date when the team is expected to release and deliver certain features to the customer or user. 

A value roadmap only works if the team is collaborative and all stakeholders work together regularly. 

# Product roadmaps: benefits, pitfalls, and best practices

Different kinds of roadmap: Project, Product, Value, Lean, Agile

Benefits: Clarify the sequence of deliverables; showing teams how their efforts relate to the north-star vision. In other words, their ultimate goal. Showing stakeholders the incremental value that will be achieved over the course of the project (rather than reviewing it as one big delivery at the end). Helping stakeholders roughly understand the layout of the work behind the deliverable

Pitfalls:Letting stakeholders think the roadmap is set and unchangeable. This may cause stakeholders to impede teams’ ability to adapt in response to new information, as well as put a lot of pressure on teams to achieve deadlines no matter what it takes. Spending too much time fine-tuning delivery dates versus keeping them rough and improving specificity as the dates get closer. Putting all the work into creating the roadmap rather than producing the deliverables 

Best practices: Make it highly noticeable to the team and refer to it frequently. Clearly indicate the highest priority items. If possible, clearly indicate the highest value items. Make it visible to your wider stakeholder group so that they can use it for their planning.  Conduct regular reviews of the roadmap with sponsors, stakeholders, and the team to ensure that it is still providing the blueprint for the project.

# Creating an effective value roadmap

### Tips:

Ensure that product release dates are only rough estimates. 

It is important the product owner and project manager or scrum master work together to develop each release plan. The release plans need to connect the product roadmap with the team’s capacity and velocity, to be realistic and lead to a sustainable pace for the team. 

To deal with hard dates or deadlines (date that cannot change), factor these into any release plans that might be affected. Communicate hard deadlines with stakeholders, have a clear understanding of “must have” features. If the team discovers it might be at risk for not meeting the deadlines, they can quickly focus on the must have features. 

Some common factors that may result in a change to the release plan:
A change in team velocity; 
A change to the product scope;
Improving the understanding of how much effort is needed to build certain features. 

The Scrum Master of Project Manager should always review the release plan before starting a Sprint planning session, to keep the team on track or bring it back to track.

# Responding to change over following a plan

How to change your plan: 
Identifying a needed change; Deciding the make the change; Implementing the change.

### Identifying a needed change: 

Candidates for change: scope, time, and costs(or resources). <=Called “triple constraint”. Also could be called the “what, when, how” of the project. 
Scope: contents of the product roadmap, items in the product backlog, the intended deliverables of the project, the intended users or customers.
Time: elements of time or layout of the deliverables over a period of time.
Costs or resources: the makeup of the Development Team, project managers, and product owners, and other business people. 

### Deciding to make the change

Identify the “”decider”; Develop and share what factors are important to the decision; Openly discuss the benefits and costs of the decision; Document the decision.

### Implementing the change

Document the change and decision-making process; Capture the change in any affected artifacts; Share the change with all affected stakeholders; Monitor the change for a certain amount of time. 

# Activity Exemplar: Make changes to your release plan

# Facilitating organizational change

Organization’s status relating to Agile: already being Agile, making the switch to becoming Agile, or not yet Agile but ready to transition. 

### Techniques to be prepared for different scenarios:

Understanding organizational culture and the change management process is crucial when introducing new ways of working. Organizational culture is based on shared workplace values and pops up in people’s behaviors, activities, the way they communicate, and how they work with each other. 

The changes take time to complete. “Change takes patient persistence.” 

Some ways to bring Agile or Scrum to a new team:

The concept of creating a sense of ownership and urgency, to increases interest, motivation, and engagement with the project outcome. Find an executive sponsor who also feels a sense of ownership for the change you are creating. Whenever possible, point out connections between the changes you are making and the company’s stated mission or values. 

How to create a sense of urgency? Ask the team, organization, and stakeholders about what’s working and what’s not working. Some examples: What is preventing us from providing the best possible product to our customers? What is preventing us from providing the best possible product to our customers? What is allowing our competitors to outperform us in this market? How can we help our teams become more productive and supported in their work? Demonstrate the incremental improvements through these questions is the true spirit of Agile. 

# The influencer change framework

Influencer: someone’s ability to lead and influence others to change their behaviors, hearts, and minds to produce meaningful, sustainable results. It is different than persuasion. Persuasion is short-term, while influence is lasting. Real influence: need others to trust you, consider you an authority, and have confidence in your decisions. When facilitating organizational change, influence is the difference between temporary changes in behavior and deep change in culture and values. 

Three keys to influence: Clarify measurable results; Find vital behaviors; Use the six sources of influence.

Vital behavior is the action an individual takes at a pivotal moment in the context of the change they are seeking. Instead of just continuing on to the next item on their to-do list, they might send an email to the Product Owner at a pivotal moment, the developer is taking a small action to enact the change they want to create. To determine vital behaviors, you might consult experts, scan the best and most-cited articles and research, or perform a culture assessment by identifying norms and customs within the team. 

### Six sources of influence:

Personal motivation: are the individuals motivated internally to engage in the new behavior? Can you help them “love what they hate”?

Personal ability: Are the individuals capable of performing the behavior? Do they have the ability, knowledge, and skills to “do what they can’t”?

Social motivation: Are there social contacts or networks encouraging or discouraging this new behavior? 

Social ability: Does the team have resources within their social network to help them carry out the new behaviors? 

Structural motivation: Are there rewards or incentives that they will receive if they perform the new behaviors? 

Structural ability: Are there, environmental factors at play that either deter or support the new behavior? Can you make the incorrect behavior harder to do than the correct behavior? 

# Coaching an Agile team

Break down role as a coach into three steps:

Design the “plays” together with the team; provide feedback to the team; celebrate and learn with the team. 

# Coaching versus managing in Agile

They are distinct leadership approaches that yield different results, and both require effective communication. Both are necessary leadership skills.

Managing style utilizes one-way communication to assign tasks and give directions. 

Coaching relies on open communication in both directions to help develop an employee’s or team’s skills, so they can be self-sufficient. 

When deciding which approach to use, ask: what is the desired outcome? What is the skill level of the team member who has encountered a problem? What does the situation need now to reach the desire outcomes?

# Agile team challenges

Four themes of Agile principles: value delivery, business collaboration, team dynamics, and culture and retrospectives.

### Value delivery: 

Some signs of challenges: missing expected delivery dates and is taking a lot longer than usual to complete tasks. 

Things to help: do more demos of the solutions  with the team to ensure they're delivering on the value roadmap. When the team pauses to take in a big picture view of the working product, they often notice areas where they can improve and speed up the work. You can also use retrospectives to ask the team if anything is slowing them down, like waiting on dependencies or communication challenges. It can also help to do a quick review with the team and make sure that everyone understands what "done" means. And finally, be sure to focus on only a few user stories per Sprint. This ensures the team finishes an item together before moving on.

### Business collaboration:

Common signs of challenges: team is overwhelmed with critical feedback or change requests from business people after they reviewed the working solution. “Us versus them” mentality between the work team and management team. 

Things to help: To start with, try addressing critical feedback and change requests by doing more demos. This ensures feedback comes in at a steady pace and that everyone involved has a shared understanding of what done means. Next, consider conducting a Solution Design Sprint, which is an entire Sprint spent working solely on the solution design. These are most effective when the working team and the business people actually sit together and collaborate on the solution. Finally, you can help your team focus by ensuring changes to the Backlog are introduced only in between Sprints. This prevents your team from getting distracted by possible changes which could stress them out and lead to resentment. 

### Team dynamics and culture:

Common signs: low team morale, grumpy, irritated. Watch out for lots of conflict: arguing a lot and issues are not getting resolved. Low conflict: they might be worried about starting a conflict because they do not feel like it is a safe environment. 

Things to help: run a team brainstorm session about how to work better together; ask them to identify some areas to improve on. Example: write down stories about worst/best team they worked on; ask team to create a list of do’s and don’ts for working together. 

Try a retrospective technique from internet. Example: Six Hats Thinking Technique. 

# Common Agile coaching challenges

Three challenges: managing a stable product roadmap; incomplete implementation of Scrum; experiencing a lack of stability within the team.

### Managing a stable product roadmap

Two main causes of an unstable PR: product ambition and product assumptions. 

Product ambition: over-promise what the project can deliver. 
Three ideas to maintain a healthy roadmap management plan between you and the Product Owner: agree up front how to handle new opportunities; set up regular roadmap reviews with the entire team; promote sharing knowledge between product owner and development team. 

Product assumptions: use unbiased user research. Allows you to confirm or reject assumptions and helps you move forward with confidence. 

### Incomplete implementation of Scrum

Partially implemented or implemented without proper support and coaching. 

Loss of clear roles and responsibilities -> Define the roles for the team and fill roles with specific individuals. 

Be tempted to skip events or blend them to save time -> can lead to reducing transparency, inspection, and adaption

Not providing the team with Scrum coaching -> Have not fulfilled role as Scrum Mater. 

Lack of team stability -> Have a quick onboarding process for new team members to help them get to know the rest of the team and understand the project. Second, use a Pair Programming style, where a new team member teams up with a colleague and starts learning on the job. This also helps if people leave the team since a partner should be able to pick up where they left off. And third, if team composition changes because members keep leaving, try having shorter Sprints.

# The evolution of Agile

Creation in 2001. One reason for its popularity is that we are in a very VUCA world.

> is the world VUCA? Or is the VUCA trying to fit in the world? I do not feel right about the idea of creating a practical concept and claim that concept is practical to raise its reputation.

The Agile Manifesto as a mindset or philosophy has not changed much in almost 30 years. The frameworks it inspired have continued changing and evolving. 

One emerging Agile framework, DevOps, combines software development and IT operations. One defines DevOps as an organizational and cultural movement that aims to increase software delivery velocity, improve service reliability, and build shared ownership among software stakeholders. 

DevOps is about growing and managing teams and organizations that can build and evolve large-scale systems at a rapid pace. 

Business agility, involves incorporating Agile principles into the wide sphere of management. 

Agile methodologies can be applied to your own personal life. Example: set Kanban board to start planning personal tasks. 

# Scaling Agile

Five frameworks that scale the Agile approach to address the needs of large initiatives or solutions: Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe), Scrum of Scrums, Large Scale Scrum (LeSS), Disciplined Agile Delivery (DAD), and the Spotify Model.

SAFe: a Lean-Agile scaling framework that draws heavily on concepts from Kanban, Scrum, … it is founded on a set of core values: alignment, built-in quality, transparency, program execution, leadership

Scrum of Scrums: a technique for integrating the work of multiple, smaller Scrum teams working on the same project or solution. Scrum master for each team that participates in the Scrum of Scrums meetings, and a Scrum of Scrums mater who focuses on the overall Scrum process across multiple teams.

LeSS: a framework that aims to maximize the Scrum team’s ability to deliver value and reduce waste in larger organizations. Ten LeSS principles: large-scale scrum is scrum, empirical process control, transparency, more with less, whole-product focus, customer-centric, continuous improvement towards perfection, systems thinking, lean thinking, queuing theory. 
Large-scale Scrum is Scrum: Apply the values and principles of Scrum to a larger team. 
Empirical process control: Inspect, adapt, and learn from experience to improve processes. 
Transparency: Ensure clarity and accessibility across a project. 
More with less: Create only necessary processes, roles, artifacts, and waste when scaling. 
Whole-product focus: Think holistically about the product, making sure that all the parts serve the whole.
Customer-centric: Keep the customer’s needs and values at the heart of your process.
Continuous improvement towards perfection: Improve the product—and your process—during every single Sprint. 
Systems thinking: Think about the system as a whole; Don’t get lost in the details. 
Lean thinking: Seek continuous improvement, aim for perfection, and respect people.
Queuing theory: Embrace the Lean principles of “flow,’ manage queue size,” and “minimize multitasking” to keep delivering value. 

DAD: a hybrid approach that combines the strategies from various Agile frameworks. Four layers: foundations, disciplined DevOps, value streams, disciplined agile. Enterprise.
Foundations discusses the principles, guidelines, Agile concepts, roles and team structure definitions, and Way of Working (WoW).
Disciplined DevOps ensures that solutions are delivered to customers effectively and safely, with data and security management always at the forefront.
Value Streams ensures that solutions are aligned with the organization's business strategy, connecting customers, sales, and portfolio management to the framework.
Disciplined Agile Enterprise (DAE) connects the industry marketplace with corporate governance and larger enterprise activities.

The Spotify Model: Squads, Tribes, Chapters, Guilds.

Scaling Agile can be as simple as putting two Scrum teams together into a Scrum of Scrums configuration or as sophisticated as training an organization of thousands in the SAFe framework. When you have a large team or a big deliverable that requires multiple work-streams, think about how you can scale to suit your situation. Remember that you can modify SAFe, LeSS, and other scaled frameworks to meet the needs of each project. Make sure your team understands Agile principles before you try to scale since scaling inevitably introduces more waste and complexity.

# Agile project management opportunities

How to land an Agile project management position? Job boards: Agile Project Manager, Scrum Mater, IT Agile Project Manager, or a DevOps Project Manager.

Question regarding Agile from interviews: What’s the difference between Agile and Waterfall project management? Looks for a few specifics things. More than just Scrum, Sprints, and Standups. But about founding values including customer collaboration, value delivery, self-organizing teams. When to use Agile approach on your project? How do you convince your team to give Agile or Scrum a try, when they resist these framework?

Questions the candidate gets to ask the interviewers. About the job, interviewer’s experience in project management, about the culture, about the job expectations. Know how crucial culture is to the success of an Agile project. 

Some question examples: how supportive is the management here towards blending project management approaches? What is the first thing I should know about the culture here? How often will I get to hear about the needs of our users or customers? And what would a typical day look like for me if I were to take on this position. 

Four things helping you bring Agile to the teams: Start small, Listen to feedback, Be strategic, Find allies.

# Creating a job search plan

Optimize your job application process by adjusting your resume, writing professional e-mails, and tracking everything in your search plan. 

> A job search plan help you establish timelines, set expectations, monitor progress, and adjust as needed to meet your goal of getting a project manager role. It enables you to track important data in each stage as you monitor your applications, interviews, and feedback. At  At each stage, you'll gather information to make decisions, like the number of resumes you need to send out each week. Your application to interview ratio, and which types of outreach and cover letter formats are working for you. You can learn more about how to create a plan like this in the course readings. Once you have your job search plan in place, it's time to start thinking about the companies and industries that interest and motivate you. Why? Having an idea about the type of business environment you want to work in helps you gain perspective about the work you want to do and how you want to bring value to an organization. Do you see yourself as part of a larger organization or in a small business? How flexible are you about location? Is there a specific industry you prefer to work in? Take this brainstorm one step further and put in on paper. Create a target company list. A target company list can be as simple as listing out the companies you think of in a spreadsheet or digital document. If you're not sure where to start, there are plenty of resources online where you can find out more information on different types of companies. For starters, you can use professional online communities and networking sites, like LinkedIn, to research companies and connect with other professionals. Career sites, like Indeed and Glassdoor, offer job postings and career tips to assist you during your job search. You can also read employer reviews and find salary information. Also, by setting up alerts from job boards, you can see what new opportunities are available and look at in-demand skills for industries that appeal to you. Another great way to gain insight about a company is a simple one: talk to the people who work there. Search within your network to see if you know anyone at companies that interest you, and send them an e-mail or a message on LinkedIn. This also can work for people you don't necessarily know but are interested in their career path and organization. Request an informal and informational interview. This will allow you to understand how the company works and common qualities people have in the roles you are interested in. Ask them: what is it like to work as a project manager for a big company? Or: what was your experience like managing projects at a start-up? Or even: what was your career path that led you to this company, and what has your path been at that company? It's equally important to share your story and why you're interested when doing your outreach. Typically, the people who reach out to me that I end up responding to are the ones who share a personal story with me. I find them compelling and sincere because it shows initiation, motivation, and authenticity—traits I find prevalent in the most successful project managers that I know. Lastly, if you're still unsure of which industry or company may be the best fit for you, it's helpful to seek some advice from people whose career you admire. These people can often act as your career mentor. A career mentor is someone who shares their own experience and knowledge with you in order to help you achieve your professional goals. In fact, my career mentor led me to Google. This person, whom I've known for over a decade at this point, was the one who introduced me to my role here. While we were only colleagues to start, he became someone I have grown to trust and admire and seek guidance from. Knowing my experience and working style, he recommended I apply for my first role here at Google, and here I am. The moral of that story is to connect with a network of your people and resources to improve your job search, and be intentional about your next step. Most importantly, be true to the passion about why you want to be a project manager. Is it that you want to help other people bring their dreams to life? Is it that you have a dream you want to bring to life? Or maybe, it's that you have a craft that you want to explore and try? What drew me to the project management role was this idea that you can make something that was just an idea a reality. There's nothing else like seeing something come to life right before your eyes, knowing that you played a key role in the launch and success of a project. It's exhilarating. Once you've thought through these things, both in your head and into an actual plan of action, your next step is to start applying to open roles at these companies. Check out the readings and activities and how to optimize your job application process by adjusting your resume, writing professional e-mails, and tracking everything in your job search plan. Enjoy, and I'll see you again in a later course to give you my tips on how to have a great interview.

# Job search project plan

The goal of this reading is to help you take control of your job search timeline and provide you with strategies for advancing your job search process. It will be most useful for people who need to find a job within a certain timeframe and who want to be as effective as possible at every stage of the process. 
This plan will help you design your timeline, set your expectations, monitor your progress, and make adjustments, as necessary, to improve your outcomes. To make the most of these recommendations, plan to put them into action once you have your resume completed and are ready to start actively applying for opportunities. 
Understanding the job search timeline 
The first step in planning your job search timeline is understanding the main factors that influence how it plays out. These factors are: 
1) the time it will take you to apply to the right job (the company that ultimately hires you)
2) the time between the application and the offer
For example, if you estimate that it will take you four weeks to apply for the right job and another three weeks between the application and the offer, you should plan to receive a job offer in seven weeks. 
We’ll begin by discussing how to develop estimates for your job search so you can plan your own timeline accordingly. 
The time it will take to apply to the right job
How long it takes you to apply to the company that you eventually work for depends on how many total roles you need to apply for, and the frequency of your applications. For example, if you determine that you’ll need to apply to 50 roles, you can do this in ten weeks at a rate of five applications per week, or in two weeks at a rate of 25 applications per week. 
It is important to estimate how many total roles you will need to apply for, as this will help you determine how many applications you’ll need to submit every week to reach your goals. To make this estimate, try and ascertain what you expect the following numbers to be, then bring these numbers together for a total number of applications you should plan to submit:
Application-to-first interview success ratio
First interview to second interview success ratio
Success rate of any additional interview rounds (as applicable)
Last interview-to-offer ratio
Here is an example:
If you presume a 20% chance of getting a first interview, a 25% chance of passing the first and second interview rounds, and a 25% chance of getting a job offer after the second interview, then you need to plan on submitting 80 applications to get a job offer.
These are metrics that you can influence. The quality of your application materials will impact how frequently you are invited to a first interview, and your interviewing skills will help you get from one round to the next. 
The time between the application and the offer 
In almost all cases, you will need to apply for the job and complete a series of interviews before receiving an offer. The amount of time that passes between the application and the job offer will depend on how many rounds of interviews there are, and how much time passes between each step. It is important to understand that this timeline is mostly in the control of the employer. Once you submit an application, they will invite you to interview based on their scheduling. For most roles, this process can take between two and four weeks. This can vary by industry, company, and role.
Track your job search
At this point in developing your plan, you should have a clear idea of how long you expect your job search to take. As you progress in your search, we recommend that you record and monitor the accuracy of your initial assumptions about your timeline. This will help you determine whether you are on track to receive your job offer under the timeline you first established, and where in the process you might be able to optimize your performance. Assumptions to track should include:
Application-to-interview success ratio
Success rate of each round of interviews (e.g., how many first interviews led to second interviews)
Number of interview rounds for each company
Tip: It is always a good idea to track details of your job search activities. You’ll gain insight into your success metrics and stay on top of important job search information that might otherwise get lost as your activities progress. You can use a tracker like this one to track your networking activities, application materials, action items, and notes from conversations. 
Next, we’ll discuss how you can improve the efficiency of your job search activities at different points in the process.

Getting interviews
There are a number of steps you can take to increase the number of interview opportunities you receive.
Apply to more jobs
Most people will be invited to interviews somewhere between 5% and 50% of the time. This means that you will need to submit between four and twenty applications to be invited to a single first-round interview. The more applications you submit, the more interview invitations you’ll receive.
Use the recommendations below to ensure that you are earning as many opportunities as possible:
Make sure you are monitoring major job aggregators (engines pulling jobs from multiple sites) such as Indeed and ZipRecruiter. You can set up alerts to receive new postings by email.
Separately track postings on LinkedIn jobs, as they might not be captured by aggregators. 
Identify companies that you’d be interested in working for based on their geographic location or other parameters. Check their career pages directly once or twice a week for new opportunities that might not appear on aggregators.
Make sure you include remote jobs in your search and consider adding other locations if relocation is an option for you.
Monitor local job referral and networking groups on Facebook and other online communities where recruiters and hiring managers share opportunities not posted elsewhere.
Send an email to people in your network, letting them know about your job search and asking them to share relevant opportunities with you. Make it easy for them to help you by explaining what type of role you are looking for and including your resume. 
Optimize your applications
In addition to increasing the number of applications you submit, you can improve the efficacy of each application by optimizing your resume and getting referrals.
First off, make sure your resume follows all the best practices outlined in this reading. 
Next, get feedback on your resume from other people. Recommendations from professionals in your target field are best, but others with experience in hiring can also help. Keep in mind that people might have different preferences, so don’t feel that you need to incorporate every word of feedback you receive. Instead, collect input from multiple people and look for advice that is consistent and makes sense to you. Your goal is to create a resume that is captivating to as many employers as possible! 
Finally, ask for referrals. Referrals are generally the best way to turn more of your applications into interviews. Most companies review employee referrals ahead of other applicants, so, at the very least, a referral increases the chances of your application being properly considered. In addition, employees referring you might be able to provide additional information on the role or the status of your application. 
Before applying for a role, check LinkedIn to see if you, or someone you know, might have a connection at the company. Ask for a referral or an introduction.
Create a list of companies where you know people. Go through each company’s careers page to see if there are relevant open roles for which you can request a referral.
Make sure that everyone you know is aware of your job search, so they can send opportunities your way. Reach out to people directly, post on social media, and mention it in conversations. Remember that opportunities can come from unexpected places such as your barber, book club, church, and more.
Tip: Some companies offer referral bonuses to their employees, so even a stranger might be open to referring you if you are a qualified candidate. Be creative when seeking out referrals, and don’t hesitate to ask.
Passing interviews
The next milestone is getting from one interview round to the next. Companies generally interview multiple candidates at every stage, so it’s to be expected that you won’t always advance to the next round. The good news is that you can increase your interview success rate by practicing and preparing. In the next course, we have an entire lesson focused on interview tips from project and program managers at Google, mock interview practice and more!
Key takeaway
If you’ve followed the strategies laid out in this guide, you should know how to develop a timeline for your job search, monitor your progress, and troubleshoot your applications and interviews to improve your outcomes. 
We encourage you to take the time to record your job search activities—starting with your first application—even if you are not actively trying to establish and maintain a particular timeline. Every application and interview experience is a learning opportunity. Plus, your goals might change over time, and information about your previous applications and interviews will help you analyze your past performance, set realistic expectations for future searches.
Knowing what to expect, and having visibility into what’s actually happening in your job search, is key to being in control of your employment, and landing the job!
