# Introduction to Agile

## Brief History

Waterfall project management methodology,
Agile, move quickly, flexibility, willingness, ability to change and adapt,
Project processes repeated many times

> project management approach based on the Agile Manifesto?:
An iterative, flexible process that incorporates necessary changes throughout the process and is based on foundational values and principles

Agile means flexibility, repetition, and openness to change,
Agile project management is an approach to project and team management based on the Agile Manifesto.
Agile Manifesto: 4 values and 12 principles.

> Companies use Agile to please customers.

## Distinguishing Agile from Waterfall

Agile embraces the reality that the world, markets, and users are uncertain and unpredictable.

Getting customer feedback more quickly, 
Key to streamlining is to reduce waste of time, etc, by increasing team and stakeholder collaboration.

Requirements, Documentations, and Deliverables.

Agile: avoid doing work that does not meet customers’ desires, comparing to waterfall, by enhancing customer communications and solving subproblems from urgent to less-urgent.

## Four values of the Agile Manifesto

value individuals and interactions over processes and tools, 
working software over comprehensive documentation, 
customer collaboration over contract negotiation, 
responding to change over following a plan.*

Use contract, but leave space for collaborative, customer-focused work.

Do plan, but respond to changes. Smoothly integrate change. 

## 12 Principles of Agile Manifesto

Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.
Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
The most efficient and effective method of information to and within a development is face-to-face conversation.
Working software is the primary measure of progress.
Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsor, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
Simplicity - the art of maximizing the amount of work not done - is essential.
The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

## Adopting an Agile Mindset

Every company should anticipate and adapt to changes. 

> VUCA, a concept for categorizing and thinking about those forces that shape our world.
It is an acronym that defines the conditions that affect organizations in a changing and complex world. VUCA: volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity.

Volatility: rate of change and churn in a business or situation.
Uncertainty: lack of predictability or high potential for surprise.
Complexity: high number of interrelated forces, issues, organizations, and factors that would influence the project. 
Ambiguity: possibility of misunderstanding the conditions and root causes of events or circumstances.

## Applying Agile in a VUCA environment

> Office Green scenario: a landscaping company focused on interior plant design. They are pursuing a new business opportunity, and they want to find a way to capture this new market full of home offices. 

More like using the mindset of VUCA to “embrace changes”, instead of ignoring the changes?
