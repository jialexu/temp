# Introduction to Agile

## Brief History

Waterfall project management methodology,
Agile, move quickly, flexibility, willingness, ability to change and adapt,
Project processes repeated many times

> project management approach based on the Agile Manifesto?:
An iterative, flexible process that incorporates necessary changes throughout the process and is based on foundational values and principles

Agile means flexibility, repetition, and openness to change,
Agile project management is an approach to project and team management based on the Agile Manifesto.
Agile Manifesto: 4 values and 12 principles.

> Companies use Agile to please customers.

## Distinguishing Agile from Waterfall

Agile embraces the reality that the world, markets, and users are uncertain and unpredictable.

Getting customer feedback more quickly, 
Key to streamlining is to reduce waste of time, etc, by increasing team and stakeholder collaboration.

Requirements, Documentations, and Deliverables.

Agile: avoid doing work that does not meet customers’ desires, comparing to waterfall, by enhancing customer communications and solving subproblems from urgent to less-urgent.

## Four values of the Agile Manifesto

- value individuals and interactions over processes and tools, 
- working software over comprehensive documentation, 
- customer collaboration over contract negotiation, 
- responding to change over following a plan.*

Use contract, but leave space for collaborative, customer-focused work.

Do plan, but respond to changes. Smoothly integrate change. 

## 12 Principles of Agile Manifesto

- Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.
- Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
- Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
- Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
- The most efficient and effective method of information to and within a development is face-to-face conversation.
- Working software is the primary measure of progress.
- Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsor, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
- Simplicity - the art of maximizing the amount of work not done - is essential.
- The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

## Adopting an Agile Mindset

Every company should anticipate and adapt to changes. 

> VUCA, a concept for categorizing and thinking about those forces that shape our world.
It is an acronym that defines the conditions that affect organizations in a changing and complex world. VUCA: volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity.

Volatility: rate of change and churn in a business or situation.
Uncertainty: lack of predictability or high potential for surprise.
Complexity: high number of interrelated forces, issues, organizations, and factors that would influence the project. 
Ambiguity: possibility of misunderstanding the conditions and root causes of events or circumstances.

## Applying Agile in a VUCA environment

> Office Green scenario: a landscaping company focused on interior plant design. They are pursuing a new business opportunity, and they want to find a way to capture this new market full of home offices. 

More like using the mindset of VUCA to “embrace changes”, instead of ignoring the changes?


# Popular Agile Frameworks

## Introduction to Scrum

Scrum from rugby, 

In Agile PM, it’s highly likely you use Scrum.

Scrum for PM, form team that work together to quickly develop and test a deliverable; work completed in short cycles; team meets daily to discuss current tasks and clear up anything that blocks their progress.

### Some terms and concepts specific to Scrum

- Backlog: central artifact in Scrum, where all possible ideas, deliverables, features, or tasks are captured for the team to work on. It is prioritized and proactively managed by the team continuously throughout the life of the project.

- Sprint: name of the time-boxed period in Scrum where work is done. One~four weeks long, most are around 2 weeks, often called “iteration”

- A Practice called the Daily Scrum, also called the Stand-up: team meets for 15mins daily during the Sprint to inspect their progress toward their goal. 

- Roles, first role is Scrum Master: ensuring team lives Agile values and principles, follows the processes and practices that the team agreed to, sharing information to the larger project team, also help the team focus on doing their best work.

- Another role is Product Owner, responsible for maximizing the value of the product and the work of the team; owns the inventory of work and has the final say on how to prioritize the work.

- Development team is responsible for how a team will deliver that product.

- Scrum has regular, predictable meetings and delivery schedules with predefined agendas and outcomes for the meetings, easy to teach new team members. 

Ideally a Scrum team should be cross-functional, around 3-9 team members. 

## The founding principles of Scrum

Characteristics of a team help to “move the Scrum downfield”: built-in instability; self-organizing teams; overlapping development phases; multi-learning; subtle control, organizational transfer of learning.

## Introduction to Kanban, XP, and Lean

###Kanban

Kan - sign; ban - board;
Provides transparent visual feedback to everyone who might be interested about the status of work in progress. 
Use boards or charts to display the progress of a project as to do in progress and done. 
This method ensures that the project team only accepts a sustainable amount of in-progress work. This is called the work-in-progress limit, or WIP limit.

The goal of trying to maximize efficiency is called flow, a core principle of Kanban.

###XP - extreme programming

>It took traditional software development activities to an extreme level. One best practice is the idea of test first development, testing parts of the product before building them in full. 
Four basic activities: Designing, Coding, Testing, and Listening. 

XP Innovative practices
>Pair Programming; Continuous integration and continuous refactoring; Avoid big design up front.

###Lean

>Five principles that serve as a recipe for improving project outcomes: define value, map value storm, create flow, establish pull and pursue perfection. 

##Blending project management approaches

A waterfall project life cycle is made up of the following phases: initiation, planning, executing and completing tasks, and closing out the project, and all of the tasks within each of these phases. 

How to blend these methods? Just do some correct decisions, find what methods you used, and say you blended those methods when making decisions… that is what I think the lecturer is trying to frame here.

## The Spotify model

It uses a unique organization system that features Squads, Tribes, Chapters, and Guilds.

Squads - team; Tribes - collections of squads; Chapters - small groups of people across a tribe with similar skills; Guilds - largest group.

Key takeaways: (these are what make more sense to me…)

Be able to adapt based on your team’s preferences and goals. Always examine the needs of your project and organization. Don’t be afraid of trial and error. Keep improving.
